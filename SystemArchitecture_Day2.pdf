DAY 2 PLANNING THE TECHNICAL FOUNDATION

Objective:

The purpose of this code is to define basic data structures for an e-commerce system. These schemas model products, orders, and delivery zones so that:
1.	Product: Details of products (like id, name, price, stock, category, etc.) can be stored and managed.
2.	Order: Customer orders and their details (such as customer info, order items, status, total amount) can be tracked.
3.	Delivery Zone: Delivery zones and their drivers can be managed to ensure smooth delivery operations.
Objective: To organize structured data for an e-commerce system, enabling products to be sold, orders to be tracked, and deliveries to be managed efficiently.
